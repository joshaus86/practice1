  <h2>Warner Bros Movie World</h2>
  <p>Warner Bros. Movie World (more commonly referred to as Movie World) is a movie studio theme park on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Its theme is based on the Warner Bros. film studio and related DC Comics properties.

It is owned and operated by Village Roadshow via Village Roadshow Theme Parks since the take over from WarnerMedia. It is currently the only film-related park in Australia, and the oldest of three Warner Brothers movie theme parks worldwide. It was opened on June 3, 1991.</p>
